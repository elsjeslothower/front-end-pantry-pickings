# Front End Pantry Pickings
## Overview
This is my Capstone project for the digital Cohort 18 at Ada Developers Academy. Pantry Pickings is a dinner party web app designed to help hosts choose an ideal recipe that is the most cost-effective (using ingredients they already have at home) while also accounting for their guests' dietary preferences and intolerances. 
Specifically, the reason I chose this Capstone idea out of all the ideas swirling around in my brain was because it intimidated me the most. React is the language I have had the most difficult time wrapping my head around, so I wanted to challenge myself while gaining some industry knowledge of what React could be capable of.
## Learning Goals
- Bring an idea to life, from conception to utilization
- Learn more about backend technologies
- Broaden my understanding of how languages are interconnected
- Ideally, complete my original idea (working App that matches ingredients with recipes)
### Timeline
The time allotted to complete this project was 15 days over three weeks. I split up this time 1:2 - one week for backend functionality, two for frontend.

## Intended MVP Featureset
- Takes ingredients as input, outputs recipes that contain the input
- Records friends' dietary preferences
- Aesthetic culinary-themed layout (if time allows)
### Elevator Pitch
Scouring through your pantry and fridge is a time-consuming and tedious task when planning for a dinner party. What if there was a way to simplify this and make dinner more fun? Introducing Pantry Pickings: the app that turns your task into a tasty adventure!
